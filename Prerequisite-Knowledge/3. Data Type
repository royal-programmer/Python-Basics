Data type:- In computer science and computer programming, a data type is an attribute of data which tells the compiler
            or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programming languages support basic data
            types of integer numbers (of varying sizes), Floating-point numbers (which approximate real numbers),
            characters and Booleans. A data type constrains the values that an expression, such as a variable or a
            function, might take. This data type defines the operations that can be done on the data, the meaning of
            the data, and the way values of that type can be stored. A data type provides a set of values from which an
            expression (i.e. variable, function, etc.) may take its values. Types of data types are listed below:
    1. None:- It is a data type that has no value. It is usually used for bypassing any variable, user defined functions
            and so on. To work on that later on.
            Eg: >>> def student():
                        None
            Here, Interpreter will not execute any error, though an empty function is being defined.
    2. Numeric:- Numeric data is of four types, these types are listed below:
        2.1. Integers:- Range negative to positive including 0. Eg: -958, 0157, 94562, -8745, etc.
        2.2. Float:- Number with decimal symbol. Eg: 12.0, -95., .58, -14.5, 6E6, -98E4, etc.
             2.2.1 Fractional Form: Eg: 65.2, -98., .25, -25.3, etc.
             2.2.2. Exponential Form: Eg: 65E9, -98E2, 2.3E9, etc.
        2.3. Complex:- It is in the form a+bj, where a and b are floats and J(or j) represents âˆš-1, which is an imaginary
             number). a is the real part and b is the imaginary number.
        2.4. Bool:- It is just True and False. It is placed in numeric data type because the value True and False held
             are 1 and 0 respectively.
    3. Sequence Type:-
        3.1. List:- It is a modifiable group of comma separated values of any datatype  between two square brackets.
             Eg: >>> lst = [12, "apples", .25, "grapes", -98, "oranges"]
        3.2. Tuple:- It is a non modifiable group of comma separated values of any data between two curve brackets.
             Eg: >>> tpl = (52, "Harry", 95, "Carry", 75, "Siddharth")
        3.4. String:- It is written between single or double or triple quotes.
             Eg: >>> str = "bat", "ball", "wicket" ,etc.
        3.5. Range:- It is a iterate type of data where values are written in the form of (start, end, steps).
             Eg: >>> rng1 = (1,9)
                 Here, it will print from 1 to 8 i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
                 >>> rng2 = (1, 9, 2)
                 Here, it will print from 1 to 8 but leaving 1 in between i.e. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.
    4. Non sequence Type:-
        4.1. Dictionary/ Mapping:- It is a data type where values are connected to a keys. It is written in between
             curly brackets. It is mutable and unordered.
             Eg: >>> dic = {"Apple":"Fruit", "Potato":"Vegetable"}
             Here, Apple, Potato are keys whereas Fruit and Vegetable are
             Values. NOTE: Keys cannot be repeated while Values can be repeated many times.
        4.2. Set:- It is a data type where similar values are not executed while printing and values are written in
             between two curly brackets.
             Eg: >>> s = {21, 25, 65, 45, 95, 21, 45, 65}
             Here, Only 21, 25, 65, 45, 95 will be printed.
