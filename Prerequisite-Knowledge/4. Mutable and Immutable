In Python, data types can be broadly categorized into two - mutable and immutable types, in simple words or modifiable
and non-modifiable types.

1. Immutable Type:- These types are those that can never change their value in place. In Python, the following types are,
    1.1. Integers.
    1.2. Floats.
    1.3. Booleans.
    1.4. Strings.
    1.5. Tuples.

2. Mutable Type:- The mutable types are those whose values can be changed in place. There are only three types of
                  mutable data types in Python. These are,
    2.1. Lists.
    2.2. Dictionaries.
    2.3. Sets.
